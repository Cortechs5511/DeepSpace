# DeepSpace

This repository contains code for the FRC Deep Space Challenge, developed by FRC Team 5511, Cortechs Robotics. We used the RobotPy library to control our robot with Python. Major features include:
* Fully implemented Command Framework to create sequential and parallelized actions.
* Vision alignment system using the Limelight Smart Camera to feed data into filtering and analysis algorithms
* Nonlinear Ramsete Controller to autonomously follow quintic spline paths with a tank drive setup
* PIDF Controllers to ensure accuracy in mechanism movement.
* Eleven Sensors incorporated to automate all aspects of gameplay

Please reach out to us if you have any questions or suggestions!
